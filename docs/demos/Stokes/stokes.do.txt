__Summary.__
The Stokes equations describe the flow of highly viscous fluids.
This is a demonstration of how the Python module "shenfun":
"https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun" can be used to solve Stokes
equations using a  mixed (coupled) basis in a 3D tensor product domain.
We assume homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions in one direction
and periodicity in the remaining two. The solver described runs with MPI
without any further considerations required from the user.
The solver assembles a block matrix with sparsity pattern as shown below
for the Legendre basis.

===== Stokes' equations =====
label{demo:stokes}

Stokes' equations are given in strong form as

!bt
\begin{align*}
\nabla^2 \bs{u} - \nabla p &= \bs{f} \quad \text{in }  \Omega, \\
\nabla \cdot \bs{u} &= h \quad \text{in } \Omega,  \\
\int_{\Omega} p dx &= 0,
\end{align*}
!et
where $\bs{u}$ and $p$ are, respectively, the
fluid velocity vector and pressure, and the domain
$\Omega = [0, 2\pi]^2 \times [-1, 1]$. The flow is assumed periodic
in $x$ and $y$-directions, whereas there is a no-slip homogeneous Dirichlet
boundary condition on $\bs{u}$ on the boundaries of the $z$-direction, i.e.,
$\bs{u}(x, y, \pm 1) = (0, 0, 0)$. (Note that we can configure shenfun with
non-periodicity in any of the three directions. However, since we are to
solve linear algebraic systems in the non-periodic direction, there is a speed
benefit from having the nonperiodic direction last. This has to do with Numpy
using a C-style row-major storage of arrays by default.)
The right hand side vector $\bs{f}(\bs{x})$ is an external applied body force.
The right hand side $h$ is usually zero in the regular Stokes equations. Here
we include it because it will be nonzero in the verification, which is using the
method of manufactured solutions. Note that the final $\int_{\Omega} p dx = 0$
is there because there is no Dirichlet boundary condition on the pressure
and the system of equations would otherwise be ill conditioned.

To solve Stokes' equations with the Galerkin method we need basis
functions for both velocity and pressure. A
Dirichlet basis will be used for velocity, whereas there is no boundary restriction
on the pressure basis. For both three-dimensional bases we will use one basis
function for the $x$-direction,
$\mathcal{X}(x)$, one for the $y$-direction, $\mathcal{Y}(y)$, and one for the
$z$-direction, $\mathcal{Z}(z)$. And
then we create three-dimensional basis functions like

!bt
\begin{equation}
v(x, y, z) = \mathcal{X}(x) \mathcal{Y}(y) \mathcal{Z} (z).
\end{equation}
!et

The basis functions $\mathcal{X}(x)$ and $\mathcal{Y}(y)$ are chosen as Fourier
exponentials, since these functions are periodic:

!bt
\begin{align}
\mathcal{X}_l(x) &= e^{\imath l x}, &\forall \, l \in \bs{l}^{N_0}, \\
\mathcal{Y}_m(y) &=  e^{\imath m y}, &\forall \, m \in \bs{m}^{N_1},
\end{align}
!et

where $\bs{l}^{N_0} = (-N_0/2, -N_0/2+1, \ldots, N_0/2-1)$ and
$\bs{m}^{N_1} = (-N_1/2, -N_1/2+1, \ldots, N_1/2-1)$.
The size of the discretized problem in real physical space is
$\bs{N} = (N_0, N_1, N_2)$, i.e., there are $N_0 \cdot N_1 \cdot N_2$ quadrature points
in total.

The basis functions for $\mathcal{Z}(z)$ remain to be decided.
For the velocity we need homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, and for this
we use composite Legendre or Chebyshev polynomials

!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Z}^0_n(z) = \phi_n(z) - \phi_{n+2}(z), \forall \, n \in \bs{n}^{N_2-2},
\end{equation}
!et

where $\phi_n$ is the n'th Legendre or Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
$\bs{n}^{N_2-2} = (0, 1, \ldots, N_2-3)$, and the zero on $\mathcal{Z}^0$
is there to indicate the zero value on the boundary.

The pressure basis that comes with no restrictions for the boundary is a
little trickier. The reason for this has to do with
inf-sup stability. The obvious choice of basis is the regular Legendre or
Chebyshev basis, which is denoted as
!bt
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{Z}_n(z) = \phi_n(z),  \forall \, n \in \bs{n}^{N_2}. label{eq:Zn}
\end{equation}
!et
The problem is that for the natural choice of $n \in (0, 1, \ldots, N_2-1)$
there is a nullspace and one degree of freedom remains unresolved. It turns out
that the proper choice for the pressure basis is simply (ref{eq:Zn}) for
$n \in \bs{n}^{N_2-2}$. (Also remember that we have to fix $\int_{\Omega} p dx = 0$.)

With given basis functions we obtain the spaces

!bt
\begin{align}
V^{N_0} &= \text{span}\{ \mathcal{X}_l \}_{l\in\bs{l}^{N_0}}, \\
V^{N_1} &= \text{span}\{ \mathcal{Y}_m \}_{m\in\bs{m}^{N_1}}, \\
V^{N_2} &= \text{span}\{ \mathcal{Z}_n \}_{n\in\bs{n}^{N_2-2}}, \\
V_0^{N_2} &= \text{span}\{ \mathcal{Z}^0_n \}_{n\in\bs{n}^{N_2-2}},
\end{align}
!et
and from these we create two different tensor product spaces
!bt
\begin{align}
W_0^{\bs{N}}(\bs{x}) &= V^{N_0}(x) \otimes V^{N_1}(y) \otimes V_0^{N_2}(z), \\
W^{\bs{N}}(\bs{x}) &= V^{N_0}(x) \otimes V^{N_1}(y) \otimes V^{N_2}(z).
\end{align}
!et

The velocity vector is using a mixed basis, such that we will look for
solutions $\bs{u} \in [W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3 \, (=W_0^{\bs{N}} \times W_0^{\bs{N}} \times W_0^{\bs{N}})$,
whereas we look for the pressure
$p \in W^{\bs{N}}$. We now formulate a variational problem using the Galerkin method: Find
$\bs{u} \in [W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3$ and $p \in W^{\bs{N}}$ such that
!bt
\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega} (\nabla^2 \bs{u} - \nabla p ) \cdot \overline{\bs{v}} \, dx_w &= \int_{\Omega} \bs{f} \cdot \overline{\bs{v}}\, dx_w \quad\forall \bs{v} \, \in \, [W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3, \\
\int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot \bs{u} \, \overline{q} \, dx_w &= \int_{\Omega} h \overline{q} \, dx_w \quad\forall q \, \in \, W^{\bs{N}}.
\end{align}
!et
Here $dx_w=w_xdxw_ydyw_zdz$ represents a weighted measure, with weights $w_x(x), w_y(y), w_z(z)$.
Note that it is only Chebyshev polynomials that
make use of a non-constant weight $w_x=1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$. The Fourier weights are $w_y=w_z=1/(2\pi)$
and the Legendre weight is $w_x=1$.
The overline in $\bs{\overline{v}}$ and $\overline{q}$ represents a complex conjugate, which is needed here because
the Fourier exponentials are complex functions.

=== Mixed variational form ===
label{sec:mixedform}

Since we are to solve for $\bs{u}$ and $p$ at the same time, we formulate a
mixed (coupled) problem: find $(\bs{u}, p) \in [W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3 \times W^{\bs{N}}$
such that

!bt
\begin{equation}
a((\bs{u}, p), (\bs{v}, q)) = L((\bs{v}, q)) \quad \forall (\bs{v}, q) \in [W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3 \times W^{\bs{N}},
\end{equation}
!et

where bilinear ($a$) and linear ($L$) forms are given as

!bt
\begin{align}
    a((\bs{u}, p), (\bs{v}, q)) &= \int_{\Omega} (\nabla^2 \bs{u} - \nabla p) \cdot \overline{\bs{v}} \, dx_w + \int_{\Omega} \nabla \cdot \bs{u} \, \overline{q} \, dx_w, \\
    L((\bs{v}, q)) &= \int_{\Omega} \bs{f} \cdot \overline{\bs{v}}\, dx_w + \int_{\Omega} h \overline{q} \, dx_w.
\end{align}
!et

Note that the bilinear form will assemble to block matrices, whereas the right hand side
linear form will assemble to block vectors.

===== Implementation =====

=== Preamble ===

We will solve the Stokes equations using the "shenfun":
"https://github.com/spectralDNS/shenfun" Python module. The first thing needed
is then to import some of this module's functionality
plus some other helper modules, like "Numpy": "https://numpy.org" and "Sympy":
"https://sympy.org":

!bc pycod
import os
import sys
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, sin, cos
from shenfun import *
!ec

We use `Sympy` for the manufactured solution and `Numpy` for testing.

=== Manufactured solution ===
label{sec:mansol}

The exact solutions $\bs{u}_e(\bs{x})$ and $p(\bs{x})$ are chosen to satisfy boundary
conditions, and the right hand sides $\bs{f}(\bs{x})$ and $h(\bs{x})$ are then
computed exactly using `Sympy`. These exact right hand sides will then be used to
compute a numerical solution that can be verified against the manufactured
solution. The chosen solution with computed right hand sides are:
!bc pycod
x, y, z = symbols('x,y,z')
uex = sin(2*y)*(1-z**2)
uey = sin(2*x)*(1-z**2)
uez = sin(2*z)*(1-z**2)
pe = -0.1*sin(2*x)*cos(4*y)
fx = uex.diff(x, 2) + uex.diff(y, 2) + uex.diff(z, 2) - pe.diff(x, 1)
fy = uey.diff(x, 2) + uey.diff(y, 2) + uey.diff(z, 2) - pe.diff(y, 1)
fz = uez.diff(x, 2) + uez.diff(y, 2) + uez.diff(z, 2) - pe.diff(z, 1)
h = uex.diff(x, 1) + uey.diff(y, 1) + uez.diff(z, 1)

!ec

=== Tensor product spaces ===

One-dimensional spaces are created using the ${func('FunctionSpace')} function. A choice of
polynomials between Legendre or Chebyshev can be made, and the size
of the domain is given

!bc pycod
N = (20, 20, 20)
family = 'Legendre'
K0 = FunctionSpace(N[0], 'Fourier', dtype='D', domain=(0, 2*np.pi))
K1 = FunctionSpace(N[1], 'Fourier', dtype='d', domain=(0, 2*np.pi))
SD = FunctionSpace(N[2], family, bc=(0, 0))
ST = FunctionSpace(N[2], family)
!ec

Next the one-dimensional spaces are used to create two tensor product spaces Q = $W^{\bs{N}}$
and TD = $W_0^{\bs{N}}$, one vector V = $[W_0^{\bs{N}}]^3$ and one mixed
space  VQ = V $\times$ Q.

!bc pycod
TD = TensorProductSpace(comm, (K0, K1, SD), axes=(2, 0, 1))
Q = TensorProductSpace(comm, (K0, K1, ST), axes=(2, 0, 1))
V = VectorSpace(TD)
VQ = CompositeSpace([V, Q])
!ec

Note that we choose to transform axes in the order $1, 0, 2$. This is to ensure
that the fully transformed arrays are aligned in the non-periodic direction 2.
And we need the arrays aligned in this direction, because this is the only
direction where there are tensor product matrices that are non-diagonal. All
Fourier matrices are, naturally, diagonal.

Test- and trialfunctions are created much like in a regular, non-mixed,
formulation. However, one has to create one test- and trialfunction for
the mixed space, and then split them up afterwards
!bc pycod
up = TrialFunction(VQ)
vq = TestFunction(VQ)
u, p = up
v, q = vq
!ec

With the basisfunctions in place we may assemble the different blocks of the
final coefficient matrix. Since Legendre is using a constant weight function,
the equations may also be integrated by parts to obtain a symmetric system:

!bc pycod
if family.lower() == 'chebyshev':
    A = inner(v, div(grad(u)))
    G = inner(v, -grad(p))
else:
    A = inner(grad(v), -grad(u))
    G = inner(div(v), p)
D = inner(q, div(u))
!ec

The assembled subsystems `A, G` and `D` are lists containg the different blocks of
the complete, coupled matrix. `A` actually contains 6
tensor product matrices of type ${cls('TPMatrix')}. The first two
matrices are for vector component zero of the test function `v[0]` and
trial function `u[0]`, the
matrices 2 and 3 are for components 1 and the last two are for components
2. The first two matrices are as such for

!bc pycod-t
  A[0:2] = inner(v[0], div(grad(u[0])))
!ec

Breaking it down this inner product is mathematically

!bt
\begin{equation}
label{eq:partialeq1}
\int_{\Omega} \bs{\overline{v}}[0] \left(\frac{\partial^2 \bs{u}[0]}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \bs{u}[0]}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 \bs{u}[0]}{\partial z^2}\right) w_x dx w_y dy w_z dz.
\end{equation}
!et

If we now use test function $\bs{v}[0]$
!bt
\begin{equation}
\bs{v}[0]_{lmn} = \mathcal{X}_l \mathcal{Y}_m \mathcal{Z}_n,
\end{equation}
!et
and trialfunction
!bt
\begin{equation}
\bs{u}[0]_{pqr} = \sum_{p} \sum_{q} \sum_{r} \hat{\bs{u}}[0]_{pqr} \mathcal{X}_p \mathcal{Y}_q \mathcal{Z}_r,
\end{equation}
!et
where $\hat{\bs{u}}$ are the unknown degrees of freedom, and then insert these functions
into (ref{eq:partialeq1}), then we obtain after
performing some exact evaluations over the periodic directions

!bt
\begin{equation}
 \Big( \underbrace{-\left(l^2 \delta_{lp} + m^2 \delta_{mq} \right) \int_{-1}^{1} \mathcal{Z}_r(z) \mathcal{Z}_n(z) w_z dz}_{A[0]} + \underbrace{\delta_{lp} \delta_{mq} \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{\partial^2 \mathcal{Z}_r(z)}{\partial z^2} \mathcal{Z}_n(z) w_z dz}_{A[1]} \Big) \hat{\bs{u}}[0]_{pqr}.
\end{equation}
!et

Similarly for components 1 and 2 of the test and trial vectors, leading to 6 tensor
product matrices in total for `A`. Similarly, we get three components of `G`
and  three of `D`.

Eliminating the Fourier diagonal matrices, we are left with block matrices like

!bt
H(l, m) =
  \begin{bmatrix}
      A[0]+A[1] & 0 & 0 & G[0] \\
      0 & A[2]+A[3] & 0 & G[1] \\
      0 & 0 &  A[4]+A[5] & G[2] \\
      D[0] & D[1] & D[2] & 0
  \end{bmatrix}
!et

Note that there will be one large block matrix $H(l, m)$ for each Fourier
wavenumber combination $(l, m)$. To solve the problem in the end we will need to
loop over these wavenumbers and solve the assembled linear systems one by one.
An example of the block matrix, for $l=m=5$ and $\bs{N}=(20, 20, 20)$ is given
in Fig. ref{fig:BlockMat}.


In the end we create a block matrix through

!bc pycod
M = BlockMatrix(A+G+D)
!ec

The right hand side can easily be assembled since we have already
defined the functions $\bs{f}$ and $h$, see Sec. ref{sec:mansol}

!bc pycod
# Get mesh (quadrature points)
X = TD.local_mesh(True)

# Get f and h on quad points
fh = Array(VQ, buffer=(fx, fy, fz, h))
f_, h_ = fh

# Compute inner products
fh_hat = Function(VQ)
f_hat, h_hat = fh_hat
f_hat = inner(v, f_, output_array=f_hat)
h_hat = inner(q, h_, output_array=h_hat)

!ec

In the end all that is left is to solve and compare with
the exact solution.

!bc pycod
# Solve problem
up_hat = M.solve(fh_hat, constraints=((3, 0, 0), (3, N[2]-1, 0)))
up = up_hat.backward()
u_, p_ = up

# Exact solution
ux, uy, uz = Array(V, buffer=(uex, uey, uez))
pe = Array(Q, buffer=pe)

error = [comm.reduce(np.linalg.norm(ux-u_[0])),
         comm.reduce(np.linalg.norm(uy-u_[1])),
         comm.reduce(np.linalg.norm(uz-u_[2])),
         comm.reduce(np.linalg.norm(pe-p_))]
print(error)
!ec

Note that solve has a keyword argument
`constraints=((3, 0, 0), (3, N[2]-1), 0)` that takes care of the restriction
$\int_{\Omega} p \omega dx = 0$ by indenting the rows in M corresponding to the
first and last degree of freedom for the pressure. The value $(3, 0, 0)$
indicates that pressure is
in block 3 of the block vector solution (the velocity vector holds
positions 0, 1 and 2), whereas the two zeros ensures that the first dof
(dof 0) should obtain value 0. The constraint on the highest
wavenumber `(3, N[2]-1, 0)` is required to get a non-singular
matrix.
